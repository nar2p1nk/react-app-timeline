# react-app-timeline

this is a list of react apps i have made in order.

not all of them are here, only the ones i have worked on
without tutorials

**note**  
during the making of this list, i didn't change anything about the projects,  
any recent commits were made to push the project to the repo because some of these  
were worked on and then just abandoned.

## 1.[sugarcube corner.](https://github.com/nar2p1nk/react-sugarcube-corner)

As you can tell, this app was inspired by the
sugarcube corner from my little pony:friendship is magic.
The 'chimicherry cherrychanga' thing was reference in one of the episodes
where pinkie pie had trouble choosing a name for her new recipe

i can't really tell you much more about this app.
all i know is that i made it back some time around may 29, 2021
was a long time ago.


## 2.[booklist](https://github.com/nar2p1nk/bookList)

I tried making some sort of list for some books i found on amazon
but ass you can see it worked perfectly

we have the picture,the title and the description of the books(the last book's text clips tho)

overall, a pretty barebone project

## 3.[todo-app](https://github.com/nar2p1nk/todo-react)

This is my first todo-app with react, it's pretty much just a todo-app but fullstack.  

The [backend](https://github.com/nar2p1nk/todoApi) is made using express.

This app also a todo-app but a bit more complex.  

at first i was just learning user authentication with express,
then i thought why not build a react app for it.  

It was a bad idea as it took weeks to design and code it but i enjoyed it nonetheless

The backend code is in the same repo btw
