# react-app-timeline

this is a list of react apps i have made in order.

not all of them are here, only the ones i have worked on
without tutorials

**note**  
during the making of this list, i didn't change anything about the projects,  
any recent commits were made to push the project to the repo because some of these  
were worked on and then just abandoned.

As you can tell, this app was inspired by the
sugarcube corner from my little pony:friendship is magic.
The 'chimicherry cherrychanga' thing was reference in one of the episodes
where pinkie pie had trouble choosing a name for her new recipe

i can't really tell you much more about this app.
all i know is that i made it back some time around may 29, 2021
was a long time ago.

I tried making some sort of list for some books i found on amazon
but ass you can see it worked perfectly

we have the picture,the title and the description of the books(the last book's text clips tho)

overall, a pretty barebone project
